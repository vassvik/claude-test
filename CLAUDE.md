# 2D Stable Fluids

OpenGL 4.3 compute shader implementation of 2D Stable Fluids with MAC staggered grid and Red-Black SOR pressure solver.

Detailed key files, architecture decisions, build/run commands, controls, and known quirks are in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`. **Only read that file when you need to perform a specific task** (e.g., building, modifying shaders, understanding the solver) — do not read it proactively on session start.
